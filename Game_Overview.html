                        <li>The player will need all possible methods to survive, especially when entering a room crowded with enemies near the door.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any buff that negates a damaging debuff is useful as these debuffs will inflict effectively double damage.</li>
                            <li>Choosing a weapon buff in early stages is not recommended, since it is likely the player will pick up different weapons later on.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Gold and Energy are not a big problem, since enemies (especially Champions) will drop more. Thus, the Sale Buff and Get Energy Buff aren't as recommended.</li>
                        <li>If the player worries that they would die early, using the Gashapon Machine in the Living Room or watching TV in the Workshop to get a good weapon can help them.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The player may also forge weapons in the Workshop and get extra support in the Garden.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Unless the player is confident of their "bullet hell" reading and dodging skills, a full defensive passive build is recommended.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This includes statues like the Statue of the Knight and Paladin, and a fast melee (Meat, Nunchaku, etc.).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Playing with a fixed D-Pad can be useful since it allows perfect movement.</li>
                        <li>Getting Milk means everything will deal the usual amount of damage.</li>

                    <ul class="SMlist">
                        <li>One person needs to be the host. They press the "Host game" button, then decide the room name ("SoulKnight" by default). They will then be presented with three checkboxes that can be checked and unchecked freely; 
                            if checked, the first enables Badass Mode, the second enables Boss Rush Mode (only available if the host has unlocked the mode and has any Feathers of Valkyrie) and the third enables challenge conditions 
                            (random ones are picked every time conditions are enabled, allowing the players to search for the ones they want. These are always different from the ones on the host's Task Board). Then, they can confirm their settings, 
                            after which they will be sent to the Living Room. Once they are done in the Living Room, the host may enter the door to initialize the game.</li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Other people should first connect to the same Wi-Fi (or a hotspot created by the host), go to the "Join game" section of Multiplayer and choose the corresponding game to join. After joining the game, they will be sent to the Living Room. 
                            Once they reach the Living Room door, joining the game is completed. Guests can only enter said door after the host does.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The door, instead of the swords clashing image indicating battle, will have a moving image of two devices connected, symbolizing that going in means the player will connect to the others' devices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>When the player is ready, enter the door and the player will arrive in the waiting room. Players in this room can practice freely on a Training Dummy until the host starts the game. All players will restore energy constantly while in the room, 
                            similar to the effect of the "Infinite energy" condition. Rings cannot be used in this room.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are four large screens on the wall of the room. If any player is in the Living Room but not ready yet, it'll show their skin on a monitor, and if they're ready, the corresponding screen will show the player with "READY" beneath the image. 
                                The player will also appear in the waiting room. Otherwise, the monitor only shows noise.</li>

                        <br>
                        <li>When at least two players are ready, the host can start the game by pressing a button with the play icon on it.</li>
                        <li>If a run has been interrupted and the players want to resume the game, they need to use the "Last game" button at the title screen. The host can continue the game if at least one player has returned.</li>

                    <p>In Multiplayer mode, many factors of gameplay change, such as:</p>
                    <ul class="PMlist">
                        <li>Chests can be larger than normal. These chests require some players to stand on separate buttons at the same time to open. These chests will give more than one weapon, depending on the number of buttons.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example, in a game with 3 players, chests may have 2 or 3 buttons while giving 2 or 3 weapons accordingly.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Shops may contain more items (big shops can contain up to 6).</li>
                        <li>Champion rooms come with more reward chests (one for each player).</li>
                        <li>Gold, energy orbs and materials are separated for each player. Only those for the players' character are visible.</li>
                        <li>All players can contribute coins to Wishing Wells (the cap remains at 50), and any payout that is not a weapon or potion can be collected by all players. However, only one player can take an item from the selection provided in Turret Rooms.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a blueprint that appears is one that a player has already collected, it will become either another blueprint or a random item for that player.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Developed weapons and armor mounts can appear randomly even if none of the players have developed them.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This also works for regular Mounts, which can appear even if the player doesn't have the right achievement.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Buffs that are chosen will apply to every player. Only the host is able to choose the Buffs.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buffs on fully-upgraded characters will also apply to all other players, even if they may be different for each character used. Buffs that anyone comes with will not show up in the choices.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example, if a game starts with a fully-upgraded Knight and a fully-upgraded Wizard, the Knight will also benefit from the Wizard's Elemental Buff, and the Wizard will also benefit from the Knight's Strong Shield Buff.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Character-exclusive Buffs are not shared.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Characters found at the start of each level can still only be interacted with by players that have unlocked them, even if one player has unlocked them but another has not.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Only the host can obtain drinks from the Beverage Vending Machine, and the drink given will only apply to them despite being visible in the pause screen for all players. The only exception is Tea, as all players share Buffs. 
                            Drinks purchased from the Waiter during the game will be given to all players regardless of who purchased the drink.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Each Statue can be worshipped once by every player. Statue effects are independent for each player.</li>
                        <li>Each player has a panel on the left of the screen showing health and energy bars for other players. Armor is not displayed. The host will also have an option to kick players from the game here, but only while in the waiting room.</li>
                        <li>Players can revive each other if someone dies. The person who had died cannot do anything until another player revives them.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to revive another player, move to that player and interact with them. The player must then remain next to the downed player until their life bar has been fully refilled (the progress of revival is shown in green) and the player is revived. 
                                It takes 5 seconds to revive a player. The player can use skills and move in a very small area around the other player while reviving, but they cannot attack with weapons. The revival attempt will be canceled if they move away during the process.</li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Players can revive each other if someone dies. The person who had died cannot do anything until another player revives them.</li>
